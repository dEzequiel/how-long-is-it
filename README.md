# How long is it

This project is done during my TypeScript learning process guided by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider) course on Udemy called [Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/).

The dependencies used are the Google Maps API, Faker library for random data generation and Parcel to execute TypeScript into browser as Javascript.
